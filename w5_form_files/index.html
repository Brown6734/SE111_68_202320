        each form element and label will have very specific attributes

        notes:
        the table itself with have one row in the <thead> and the rest of the form will reside in the <tbody>
        the heading at the top of the page will go outside of the <table>

        Once the form is submitted it will redirect you to a confirm.html page. 
        YOU SHOULD NOT EDIT ANYTHING on the confirm.html page
